## The first time use markdown language writing notations.

### The first coding challenge "Two sum".

#### Aactually,a simple way is using multiple loop as the first solution. However, a lot of people use hash table.  Today I want to 'learn'(how to say, almost forgot how to use the hash table,lol) the Hash Table.

Hash Table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value. Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.

Thus, it becomes a data structure in which insertion and search operations are very fast irrespective of the size of the data. Hash Table uses an array as a storage medium and uses hash technique to generate an index where an element is to be inserted or is to be located from.

## Hashing

Hashing is a technique to convert a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array. We're going to use modulo operator to get a range of key values. Consider an example of hash table of size 20, and the following items are to be stored. Item are in the (key,value) format.
