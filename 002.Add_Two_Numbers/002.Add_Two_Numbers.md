# Linked List

  A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.
  Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link.

## Types of linked list 
  - Simple Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List

# Inserting a node
## Add a node at the front:(4 steps process)
  The new node is always added before the head of the given Linked List. And newly added node becomes the new head of the Linked List. For example if the given Linked List is 10->15->20->25 and we add an item 5 at the front, then the Linked List becomes 5->10->15->20->25. Let us call the function that adds at the front of the list is push(). The push() must receive a pointer to the head pointer, because push must change the head pointer to point to the new node.

## Add a node after a given node: (5 steps process)
  We are given pointer to a node, and the new node is inserted after the given node.

## Add a node at the end: (6 steps process)
  The new node is always added after the last node of the given Linked List. For example if the given Linked List is 5->10->15->20->25 and we add an item 30 at the end, then the Linked List becomes 5->10->15->20->25->30.
Since a Linked List is typically represented by the head of it, we have to traverse the list till end and then change the next of last node to new node.
